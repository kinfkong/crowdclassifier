* category-src - all the sources for my submission
* test-harness - I modified a little about the test-harness because:

Because the data of the categories are not normalized, it may:

1). singular vs plural. For example, `Carpools` vs `Carpool` 
2). typo exists. For example, `shttles`, `priavte`
3). dash symbol. For example, `self driving cars` vs `self-driving cars`
So, I updated the test-harness to handle these cases.

so, please use the test-harness in my submission to test with the test data.
